# stats220
This is my repo for STATS 220.
A little about me:
- I am undertaking a degree in BSc majoring in Physiology — the study of how the human body works  : ) 
- I am taking STATS 220 because I really liked stats 101, want to further understand statistics, and learn how to code
- I am interested in learning about the different ways I can use coding, in my degree




A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is:
